      <h5 class="page-subheader">Overview</h5>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Surreality is an iOS physics-based puzzle game developed in Swift over 6 weeks.
        The game has <span class="page-bold">200+ levels, amassing 250+ downloads</span>
        on the iOS App Store. The game features beautiful graphics and well-designed
        levels, with various different special blocks slowly introduced into the game
        as time goes on.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I spent 400+ hours total over these six months and various times afterwards
        developing the app. I carefully designed the UX, slowly introducing concepts
        so the user clearly understands what to do in each level. I later introduced
        two major updates to the game, adding new themes, skins, and modes. For my
        efforts, I was <span class="page-bold">awarded the audience choice award out
        of 100+ other apps</span>.

      <h5 class="page-subheader">Process</h5>
      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Development</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I designed and developed the game over a five-week period. I started by coding
        the main mechanics of the game, introducing only a few levels. As time went on,
        I considered the user experience, designing dozens and dozens of levels at a time.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        The interface design was a graphics design I wanted to work with for a long time.
        The shadows, colors, and stripes were simply so appealing. There are four different
        themes, with them randomly interchanging as levels are completed. Particles are used
        to add to the "surreal" ambience of the game, and animations were heavily utilized
        to add to the smooth gameplay.

      <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Testing</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Once a few dozen levels were completed, I tested the app with many different test
        users, using implemented analytics to track their progress and pitfalls. I found
        that the beginning level curve was too steep, so I expanded the first five levels
        to twenty-five, teaching small but important concepts each and every single level.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        After testing, I designed the rest of the game as a 200+ level tutorial, teaching
        concepts every single level. If a level does not teach something, it is not
        useful and cut. In addition, I implemented difficulty spikes to introduce
        feelings of accomplishment after completion. Post-launch analytics indicate that
        these spikes do work.
      </p>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Updates</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        After launch, I updated the game twice with major overhauls. The first I
        introduced a snow theme, adding particles and snow layers to each block to celebrate
        the holidays. I also introduced 12 skins that are unlocked in special ways, with
        plans to add in more in the form of in-app purchases. The second update introduced
        a new challenge mode, which challenged the user to complete the first ~80 levels
        without using momentum, many of which are incredibly difficult.
