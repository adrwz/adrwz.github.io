      <h5 class="page-subheader">Overview</h5>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I developed an application designed to create, store, edit, and export members
        in a Java program using the JavaFX framework that combined Java with XML code,
        making it easy to build desktop applications. The application won <span class="page-bold">
        first place at California FBLA States</span> because of a well-designed program
        and a solid, confident pitch.
      </p>

      <h5 class="page-subheader">Process</h5>
      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Development</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I spent three months building the application, working many hours after school
        on it. I spent time on working on my pitch deck to pitch to judges as well. The
        The application can add, delete, and edit users. It can also open and export as
        its own custom file. The app can create a report that can be exported as a CSV
        file or printed.

      <p class="page-paragraph">
        The application is built using SceneBuilder (which automatically generated the
        XML code) and JavaFX, which combined the XML code with the Java logic. A blue
        color scheme was used, per the competition organization's logo.
