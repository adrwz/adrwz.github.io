      <h5 class="page-subheader">Overview</h5>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Quickey is a productivity app that quickly launches new tabs with a push of a
        key. It was created by a past UCLA student in response to new tab apps like
        Momentum that do not have much functionality in an attempt to make one's life
        more productive and less annoying. As a front-end developer, I was tasked with
        further building the product and facilitating its design as well.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        So far, <span class="page-bold">350,000+ tabs have been launched</span> over
        thousands of users through our application, saving 17,500+ minutes of people's
        time. The extension has been rated an average of <span class="page-bold">4.9/5
        stars with 200+ ratings</span>, with people expressing interest in paying for
        a plus version with highly-requestes features. Because of this, my task was
        to implement these features and to put it behind a Stripe paywall.

      <h5 class="page-subheader">Process</h5>
      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Development</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Because the code was not previously documented well, it was a pain to understand
        how it ultimately worked. Lots of time was dedicated to thouroughly understanding
        React/Redux worked and how the existing code worked.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Using React and the Chrome Extensions API, I implemented the workspace. I had to
        balance the functionality with good design and animation. These features are set
        to launch January of 2019, and hopefully they will prove to be useful for our
        users.
