      <h5 class="page-subheader">Overview</h5>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I founded and maintained Mindspark Summer, a top-rated summer program
        dedicated to providing a fun, hands-on environment for students. I
        <span class="page-bold">singlehandedly generated over $53,000 in
        revenue</span> over the past two years, and maintained an average of a
        9/10 rating among over 120 students throughout our history.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Tasks include business management, extensive online and guerilla marketing,
        developing the web platform, writing and developing the 400+ page curriculum,
         and teaching and managing day-to-day operations during the program.
      </p>

      <h5 class="page-subheader">Process</h5>
      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Conception</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I started the company back in 2015. Due to the fact that I started it very
        late into the season, I only gathered five students, teaching basic robotics
        skills over a week while losing money. Despite this failure, I had gathered
        the experience necessary to understand the industry better to run it in future
        years.
      </p>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Re-Launch</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Two years later, I decided to use the experience I'd gained to re-launch the
        camp, almost completely from scratch. I built a web platform from scratch
        that handled everything from surveys to a landing page to analytics to
        signups and payments. I wrote three hundred pages of curriculum for 4 classes,
        and taught the web course, hiring others to teach the other courses.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        The result was a camp with 40+ students over four weeks with four different
        courses. This year, I generated $15,000 in revenue, and while impressive,
        it was not enough to create for a minimum wage job for myself after paying
        off the costs.
      </p>

      <img src="../images/mindspark/3.jpg" class="page-img"/>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Final Year</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Taking all the experience I'd gained, I decided to run the camp one final
        year. I also had significantly more time at that time, so I poured all of
        my time and energy into the business.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I significantly increased every aspect of my marketing plan, aggressively
        pursuing many different marketing and business strategies I had not previously
        thought of in the past. I created a new two-week course, and  brought on
        various mentors including <a href="http://www.davidshenventures.com/bio.shtml" class="page-p-link">David Shen</a>, a venture capitalist
        who designed the Yahoo logo.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        For my efforts, I generated a further $38,000 in revenue with 80+ total
        students. This time, I had plenty after paying off what I owed to pay partially
        for college. I refined the curriculum, improved the hiring process, and hired
        higher quality instructors to make the camp significantly more fun for the
        students.
      </p>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Business Model</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I understood the audience, and thus priced the camp at a high price while
        giving absurdly high discounts. This would give a credibility boost I
        desperately needed, while keeping the price at a reasonable level. Introductory
        courses costed $449, while intermediate courses were $499. I later
        realized that Bay Area parents invest their kids' time, not the money, so thus
        my high prices were further justified.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I structured the marketing timeline by doing an initial brand recognition
        push initially before February, beginning to push for registrations by
        mid-March. Registrations sharply decrease after promotions conclude, thus
        I structured a lot of marketing pushes around this time to fit that.
        April is an incredibly slow month, lying awkwardly between the early birds
        and the last-minute registrations, so thus I slowed the marketing then.
        Finally,
      </p>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Marketing Strategy</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I knew I had to get the company's name out there, and I knew I needed to gather
        valuable market data, so I released a marketing survey promising a $50 discount
        on the camp. Upon submission, the user is greeted with a 48-hour countdown
        promising $100 off if they register within the next 48 hours, with an email sent
        at the 24-hour mark, to create urgency and encourage registrations.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        As March approached, I began aggressively working on social media and guerilla
        marketing, targeting parents of kids of age 11-18. I flyered everywhere, posted
        in social media groups with special discount codes, and sent hundreds of cold
        emails to school administration, PTSAs, and programming clubs for promotion, all
        while carefully analyzing analytics data to see which marketing strategies worked
        and how I can improve the UI/UX design for the landing page.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        As time went on, I began to attend summer camp fairs to directly connect with
        parents. In addition, I began to purchase paid advertisements on Facebook and
        on Google AdWords using funds I collected through prior registrations.
      </p>

      <img src="../images/mindspark/6.jpg" class="page-img"/>

      <p class="page-paragraph">
        On the supply side, I did a bunch of job postings, promising a high wage for
        instructors. I conducted countless interviews and read through countless
        resumes to hand-select the best possible fit of our core value of a fun
        and engaging environment.
      </p>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Reflection &amp; Conclusion</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Ultimately, through this experience, I grew significantly as a person and as
        an entrepreneur. Before then, I was the shy kid at school. I pushed myself
        to constantly exit my comfort zone during this project, and despite
        significant moral speedbumps (especially flyering and cold-emailing), I
        continued to work hard, making the business a success while simultaneously
        improving myself as a person.
