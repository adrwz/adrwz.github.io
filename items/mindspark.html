                Over the past two years, <b>I singlehandedly generated $53,000 in revenue</b>. By learning business skills on the fly, and by using my great time management skill, I managed to gather hundreds of customers and make the business a massive success.

                <b>Process</b>
            </h4>
            <p class="description">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started the company by myself back in 2015. We were approached by the building owners about the idea in April of 2015, and we started planning and marketing in May of 2015. We failed, gathering only five students.
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of this, I realized I gained experience in not just marketing, but on instructional skills. As a result, I opened the camp again in 2017.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late 2016, I started working on a completely new website design from scratch, with a full functioning system of student and parent accounts, dashboards, curriculum, and a complicated signup form. I wrote three hundred pages of curriculum for four classes and uploaded it onto the dashboard. I refined the business and the marketing strategy so we could potentially find more success.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We began our marketing campaign in January of 2017. We started with a marketing survey, which simultaneously collected valuable market data, put our name out there before our competitors, gave us a potential email list to work with in the future, and implemented the Foot in the Door persuasion technique to commit respondents so that they're more likely to make a larger purchase after a smaller commitment.
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I continued our marketing campaign by using available free and social media options. I used Facebook Pixel data to optimize the landing page to maximize conversion rates, learning UX design in the process.
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with the funds I'd collected through sales with the social media postings, I printed hundreds of flyers to distribute to parents in person so I could personally build a relationship with them making it more persuasive. Furthermore, I launched paid advertisement campaigns with Facebook ads and Google AdWords, all leading to our landing page, of which we constantly update and experiment with to conform with analytics data.
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I followed a similar forumula in 2018, pursuing more intense guerilla marketing tactics and marketing more aggressively throughout the year due to increased time. I opened a new business class, teaching students what we'd learned from our experiences over the years. I went through a hiring process with long interviews and training sessions for the new sessions and open teaching slots.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, we made <b>$53,000 in revenue</b>, over two years, with $35,500 in expenses (location, hiring, marketing, etc.). This was a rewarding experience, and I look forward to running it again in 2018.

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a software engineering intern at Tutorfly, a peer-to-peer tutoring platform that pairs struggling students with tutors that have taken the same courses at the low price of just $25/hour.

            <p class="description">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surreality is a beautiful, physics-based iOS puzzle game where players launch a ball to clear all of the blocks on screen. With 10+ powerups and modifiers, and 200+ levels, Surreality provides for almost endless entertainment and challenge.
            </p>
            <p class="description">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surreality was coded in Swift and SpriteKit over ~500 total hours. The game was less an exercise in coding and algorithms, and more of an exercise in User Experience design and level/difficulty curve design.
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I spent endless hours play-testing, changing small level design features, and testing it again. I realized that I made my initial levels much more difficult than I'd expected, so I added extra levels to "teach" the player in-game concepts. My goal was to use no text during the tutorial levels, so I had to teach the player concepts through levels. For example, for me to teach the player how angled blocks worked, I had a single angled block facing up, so that once the player hits the block, he/she sees that it bounces the ball, changing its direction 90 degrees.
                <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working on this app exposed me to Silicon Valley startup culture, and it solidified my love for computer science.
