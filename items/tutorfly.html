      <h5 class="page-subheader">Overview</h5>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Tutorfly is a San Diego-based startup that went through the StartupUCLA accelerator over
        summer of 2017. From its pilot program, 600+ hours of tutoring have taken place over
        150+ tutors. Tutorfly's clients have averaged a 10% increase in final grades; even
        more have been completed in the company's two-year lifespan. Today, Tutorfly has
        expanded to 50+ schools with another 700+ online tutors.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        As a software engineering intern at this company, I contributed to the code base with
        half a dozen other college developers. The platform is built with React and Meteor
        with MongoDB as its backend database, and we used Gitlab as our version control.
        As a business development intern, I was in charge of various different programs such
        as the ambassadors program to foster platform growth, I designed marketing materials,
        and I led the development of the Tutorfly Web Development Course that attracted 45+
        students.

      <h5 class="page-subheader">Process</h5>
      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Software Engineering Intern</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        As a software engineer at Tutorfly, I had to work in React and Meteor to develop
        the web platform and make improvements to it. My tasks included revamping the
        tutor sorting algorithm to sort by school, restructuring the code for better future
        efficiency, and designing and implementing the new landing page (pictured above).

      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Interning here was my first experience with ES6, React, Redux, and Meteor, so picking
        the framework up was especially challenging. I had to familiarize myself with the
        codebase as well, which took a long time. Most importantly, I learned collaborative
        coding, as I had to work together via Gitlab to put the platform together; this
        will serve as an important skill in future in software engineering jobs.
      </p>

      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Business Development Intern</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        As a business development intern, I took part in developing many different things
        including the ambassador program, designing new wireframes for the dashboard, and
        designing and taking photos for a recent massive paid marketing push. That said,
        my main project was developing and executing the Tutorfly Web Development Course
        which would serve to further our community service image.

      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Taking from my experiences with <a href="mindspark.html" class="page-p-link">
        Mindspark Summer</a>, I designed the program, marketed it, and hired people to
        teach. We decided to have two locationsâ€”one in the bay area, one in Los Angeles.
        The courses ended with 45+ students, which furthered the company's image as a
        community-driven altruistic company.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Marketing-wise, I sent hundreds of cold emails to see if anyone would be willing
        to promote the course. We did some social media marketing, focusing on posting
        in accessible social groups. We did paid advertisements, focusing on promoting
        through Peachjar to reach many middle schools around the location we wanted to
        hold the camp at. I designed all marketing materials in addition to all of this.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I had the opportunity to live for a week in San Diego to work with the full-time
        team through this opportunity to more efficiently get work done. I learned a lot,
        both in business and in software engineering.
