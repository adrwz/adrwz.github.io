      <h5 class="page-subheader">Overview</h5>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        LA Hacks is one of the biggest hackathons in the US, with <span class="page-bold">
        1,000+ hackers every year</span>, thus making marketing a vital part of the
        hackathon's success. The year starts in the fall, with the event taking place
        in the Spring.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        I am one of the two marketing team members, joining a team of a total of 30+ to
        make the event a success. I work closely with the design team to implement
        various different designs into our social media marketing, while working with
        Hacker Operations, sponsorships, and tech to publicize whatever they need.

      <h5 class="page-subheader">Process</h5>
      <h6 class="page-subsubheader">Marketing Plan</h6>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Marketing for LA Hacks has a social media marketing focus, with not much else going
        on. This year, we hoped to go above and beyond and grow the Instagram so that it is
        a lot bigger than it currently is by posting consistenly and publicizing its
        existence.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Further, we plan to release various videos to post on our social media accounts to
        promote the event. We also created a Medium blog to keep us relevant throughout the
        year, while doing hard advertisement pushes after applications come out and when the
        hackathon is just around the corner.
      </p>
      <p class="page-paragraph">
        Because fundraising is especially a problem this year, we were also tasked to market
        a Spark campaign, which is an internal UCLA fundraising campaign where many people
        can donate to the cause. We further promoted this fundraising campaign over our
        social media accounts.
