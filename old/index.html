            <p id="about-text"><br/><br/><br/><br/>Ever since I was a kid, I've never enjoyed going down the path everyone expects. This led to my passion for entrepreneurship - a bumpy yet unforgettable road trip, and software development - a thrilling yet difficult ride.
                <br/><br/></p>
            <h4 id="about-header-2">Entrepreneurship</h4>
<p id="about-text">My life took a 180 degree turn when I began getting into my development of leadership skills. At first, I begrudgingly developed these skills to improve my chances for getting into college, but little did I know I would find it so thrilling and satisfying.<br/><br/>
I never thought I would enjoy organizing major events. I never thought I would enjoy running meetings to accomplish results I now feel proud of, even if it meant enduring stressful periods to make it happen. Because, in the end, it's always worth it.<br/><br/>
This is why, when given the opportunity to launch a startup over the summer, I <i>carpe diem'd</i> it! In less than a month, I recruited two teammates to create and host our inaugural Mindspark Summer Camp for aspiring middle school programmers. We had as much of a blast as our student campers; this year, we're doing it again with more time, more funding, and a <i>lot</i> more experience.<br/><br/>
With the invaluable lessons learned from leading the business, and with my two and a half years of teaching computer science, we will make it a huge success.
    <br/><br/></p>
<h4 id="about-header-2">Development</h4>
<p id="about-text">Ever since I started taking Java courses in high school, I've loved programming and app development. I began with learning fundamentals to creating complicated applications to branching out to other programming realms such as mobile and website development.<br/><br/>
Using my three years of coding expertise, I conceived, built, and launched an iPhone game, deployed three websites, and created multiple Java games and apps. These ranged from an interactive database application managing club members to a 2D multiplayer competitive game with 6,000 lines of code.
    <br/><br/></p>
        <p id="about-text">I am a person who cares little for what society wants me to do. Who refuses to follow the crowd. Who is willing to go out of his way to build unique, special products and organizations that will improve our quality of life.</p>

                            Introducing the innovative minimalistic puzzle game - with two hundred hand-crafted unique levels and intriguing, challenging gameplay, players never get bored.<br/>
The objective of the game is to launch a wrecking ball to clear all of the on-screen blocks. Every few levels, new obstacles are introduced to raise the bar and keep it fresh.

                            Surreality was created at Make School Summer Academy.
Just two weeks was spent on programming the game, since conceptually, it was not a very difficult game to code. The rest of the three weeks of time was spent on designing the game so that the user would not ever get bored.<br/>
In the beginning, I had planned on three hundred levels. Naturally, going through these three hundred levels would be extraordinarily tedious, so I had to spend lots of time perfecting the difficulty curve and figuring out when and how I would introduce new concepts.<br/>
Additionally, I had to spend time doing app store optimization, cutting out unneeded features and designing the wordless tutorial levels to perfection so that the player would not quit before they had completed the first ten levels.

                            At the end, I came up with a stylistic and minimalistic puzzle game with a total of two hundred levels. The art style looks very nice, the levels are done in a way that I am happy with, and everything worked out perfectly. I was awarded the Make School Audience Choice award for my efforts, which made my game one of the top two out of a hundred total apps.

                            In 2015, I founded a robotics summer program, called Mindspark, dedicated to teaching kids how to work with robotics while making the course as fun as it could possibly be. We started late, in May. While we only got five students, the students thought the program was fantastic.<br/>
This year, we are doing it again, but this time we have started far earlier, we are writing hundreds of pages worth of curriculum material, we have built a website from scratch (including a custom built student dashboard), and we have expanded marketing efforts dramatically to gain the students that we need.

                            The experience from 2015 was the most valuable thing I got from this. I now understand what it feels like to go through the creation of a new business. I have learned valuable lessons, specifically that it is important to not regret mistakes, but to learn from them. The most successful entrepreneurs have failed more than their competitors have tried. This year, with this experience, I plan to make the entire summer program very successful!

                            This membership application was created with guidelines from a prompt for a Future Business Leaders of America technology competition.<br/>
I was already proficient at Java at the time of development for this application. However, to create an application that not only works but also looks great, I had to learn a new Java platform, called JavaFX, which is a platform that replaces Java.swing. I programmed the entire application, and styled it using CSS.

It not only looked nice, but the user experience was very well-designed and it is easy to figure out what is going on in the program. This program got first place at a Future Business Leaders of America state-level competition.
